# Notes
Links I don't want to lose but don't want to clutter in the main part of the project.




15 seconds for tcollector found here - http://opentsdb.net/docs/build/html/user_guide/utilities/tcollector.html
Collectd calls the resolution "Interval" and is 10s - https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Interval
diamond default value is here - http://diamond.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting-Started/Configuration/
Ceilometer doesn't have documentation on the default interval but I found this: https://ask.openstack.org/en/question/5882/how-to-change-the-polling-period-of-ceilometer/
