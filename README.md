# what we talk about when we talk about telemetry
The goal of this repository is to have a shared definition of telemetry. We can then differentiate telemetry tools. I hope you'll help.

## What is telemetry?
DEFINITION TBD

**My working definition:** Telemetry captures data from multiple sources, aggregates it, and publishes it in a consumable format. What happens after you collect and publish the information is beyond the scope of telemetry.

## Comparison

| framework | Default Resolution | What's most important? | ? | written in | language specific |
|:----------|:-------------------|:-----------------------|:--|:-----------|:------------------|
| snap      | 1 second           |                        |   | Go         | N                 |
| collectd  | 10 seconds         |                        |   | C          |                   |
| diamond   |                    |                        |   | Python     | Y                 |
| telegraf  |                    |                        |   | Go         |                   |
