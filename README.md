# what we talk about when we talk about telemetry
The goal of this repository is to have a shared definition of telemetry. We can then differentiate telemetry tools. I hope you'll help.

## What is Telemetry?
**My working definition:** Telemetry captures data from multiple sources, aggregates it, and publishes it in a consumable format. What happens after you collect and publish the information is beyond the scope of telemetry.

## Comparison
Telemetry frameworks are often conflated with entire monitoring solutions. I would like to clarity the differences.

### Overview

### About Collecting and Publishing
The core functionality of telemetry frameworks.

### About Operational Use
The cost of using these tools, from an operations perspective, is important to comparing them.
