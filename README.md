# what we talk about when we talk about telemetry
The goal of this repository is to have a shared definition of telemetry. By working on a common vocabulary, we can then differentiate tools in an unbiased way. I hope you'll help.

## What is Telemetry?
**My working definition:** Telemetry captures data from multiple sources, aggregates it, and publishes it in a consumable format. What happens after you collect and publish the information is beyond the scope of telemetry.

### Parts of Telemetry Frameworks
This gets tricky. I can only start with what I'm curious about, which includes:

* operational ease of use (API and restarts required)
* collection from multiple sources (aka sensors)
* interval of collection (aka resolution)
* publishing to multiple sources (aka sources)

## Comparison
Telemetry frameworks are often conflated with entire monitoring solutions. I would like to clarity the differences. To do so, I'm going to focus on only the telemetry portion of lots of tools.

### Overview

I will focus only on projects that have public releases from this point forward.

### About Collecting and Publishing
The core functionality of telemetry frameworks.

| Tools                               | Default Interval | Custom Interval?   | Multiple Intervals? | Collect from multiple sources? | Able to Process data? | Publish to multiple sources? |

### About Operational Use
The cost of using these tools, from an operations perspective, is important to consider.
